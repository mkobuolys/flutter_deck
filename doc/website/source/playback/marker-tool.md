The marker tool allows you to draw on top of the slide. It can be used to highlight specific parts of the slide, or to draw anything you want. The tool is available in the presenter toolbar, or just press "M" on your keyboard (it's also possible to specify a custom key binding for the `toggleMarker` shortcut in `FlutterDeckShortcutsConfiguration`).

- refactor: remove the `FlutterSlideImageRenderer` class
  - **BREAKING**: the `FlutterSlideImageRenderer` was moved to the `flutter_deck` package. Thus, importing it from this package will no longer work.
    - **Migration**: import `FlutterSlideImageRenderer` from `package:flutter_deck/flutter_deck.dart` instead.
